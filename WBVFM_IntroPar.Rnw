\section{Abstract}
  Since 1945, over \$4.9 trillion dollars of international aid has been allocated (\cite{tierney_more_2011}).
 To date there have been no estimates of the regional impact of this aid on the carbon cycle.  
 We apply a geographically explicit matching method (\cite{andam_measuring_2008}) to estimate the impact of World Bank projects implemented between 2000 and 2010 on sequestered carbon, using a novel and publically available dataset of \Sexpr{proj_count} World Bank project locations \footnote{http://aiddata.org/level1/geocoded/worldbank}. 
 Considering only carbon sequestered due to fluctuations in vegetative biomass caused by World Bank projects, we estimate a global net positive increase in sequestration totaling \Sexpr{tonnes_sequestered} tonnes. 
However, we illustrate the apparent effectiveness of environmental safeguards (\cite{laurance_reducing_2015}) implemented by the World Bank are variable across different geographic contexts.  
We argue that subnational data can be helpful in the identification of these heterogeneous impact effects, and highlight the considerable methodologic barriers which still exist.

\section{Introduction}



The Introduction should summarize briefly the background and aims, and end with a brief statement of what has been achieved by the work.

\section{Methods}
This section should contain sufficient detail so that all procedures can be repeated (in conjunction with cited references). Where specific equipment and materials are named, the manufacturerâ€™s name, city and country should be given (generally in parentheses after first mention).

\section{Results}
The Results section should present the experiments that support the conclusions to be drawn later in the Discussion. The Results section should conform to a high standard of rigour. Extended lines of inference, arguments or speculations should not be placed in the Results.

\section{Discussion}
The Discussion section should be separate from the Results section. It allows authors to propose their interpretation of the results, and to suggest what they mean in a wider context. It should end with a clear statement of the main conclusions of the research, and a clear explanation of their importance and relevance to applied conservation and/or policy.
