	abstract = {Global efforts to reduce tropical deforestation rely heavily on the establishment of protected areas. Measuring the effectiveness of these areas is difficult because the amount of deforestation that would have occurred in the absence of legal protection cannot be directly observed. Conventional methods of evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas can be biased because protection is not randomly assigned and because protection can induce deforestation spillovers (displacement) to neighboring forests. We demonstrate that estimates of effectiveness can be substantially improved by controlling for biases along dimensions that are observable, measuring spatial spillovers, and testing the sensitivity of estimates to potential hidden biases. We apply matching methods to evaluate the impact on deforestation of Costa Rica's renowned protected-area system between 1960 and 1997. We find that protection reduced deforestation: approximately 10\% of the protected forests would have been deforested had they not been protected. Conventional approaches to evaluating conservation impact, which fail to control for observable covariates correlated with both protection and deforestation, substantially overestimate avoided deforestation (by over 65\%, based on our estimates). We also find that deforestation spillovers from protected to unprotected forests are negligible. Our conclusions are robust to potential hidden bias, as well as to changes in modeling assumptions. Our results show that, with appropriate empirical methods, conservation scientists and policy makers can better understand the relationships between human and natural systems and can use this to guide their attempts to protect critical ecosystem services.},

These maps are used in stakeholder workshops and/or public discourse, but have often been highly contentious and counterproductive. We propose that quantifying and visualizing some of the uncertainty involved in making such maps could decrease their potential for causing conflict, thereby facilitating discourse and eventually, conservation action. We propose that an extra bonus could be attained by mapping the effects of missing or sparse input data regarding landowner “willingness to conserve” (given fair market compensation). The primary contributions of this action research are in the development of the propositions and in their implementation using a stochastic approach (Monte Carlo simulation). Preliminary assessment of the propositions occurred, but further research is needed to more formally evaluate them. Some practical suggestions and additional research considerations are provided.},

	abstract = {Forest harvest scheduling is a complicated management exercise because of the diverse and competing uses of forest resources, such as economic productivity, recreation and flora and fauna sustainability. In an effort to ensure the long-term viability of forest resources, restrictions are typically placed on the size of harvest areas, green-up intervals and proximity between disturbed areas in the United States. In order to satisfy consumer demands and maintain spatial and temporal restrictions, forest planners rely widely on optimization models to develop harvest schedules. A problematic element of work to date, however, is that spatial information relied upon in such analysis is typically uncertain in many ways, particularly spatial location and harvest unit boundaries. This paper develops new optimization models that explicitly account for spatial uncertainty in harvest scheduling. Application results demonstrate the effectiveness of this new perspective, enabling potential spatial uncertainty impacts to be better understood in management planning.},

It takes a practical, unified approach to geostatistics-integrating statistical data with physical equations and geological concepts while stressing the importance of an objective description based on empirical evidence. This unique approach facilitates realistic modeling that accounts for the complexity of natural phenomena and helps solve economic and development problems-in mining, oil exploration, environmental engineering, and other real-world situations involving spatial uncertainty.Up-to-date, comprehensive, and well-written, Geostatistics: Modeling Spatial Uncertainty explains both theory and applications, covers many useful topics, and offers a wealth of new insights for nonstatisticians and seasoned professionals alike. This volume:* Reviews the most up-to-date geostatistical methods and the types of problems they address.* Emphasizes the statistical methodologies employed in spatial estimation.* Presents simulation techniques and digital models of uncertainty.* Features more than 150 figures and many concrete examples throughout the text.* Includes extensive footnoting as well as a thorough bibliography.Geostatistics: Modeling Spatial Uncertainty is the only geostatistical book to address a broad audience in both industry and academia. An invaluable resource for geostatisticians, physicists, mining engineers, and earth science professionals such as petroleum geologists, geophysicists, and hydrogeologists, it is also an excellent supplementary text for graduate-level courses in related subjects.},

These stochastic images are conditioned to a variety of data accounting for their specific measurement scale and reliability. Any geostatistical prediction is built on a prior model of spatial correlation that ties data to unsampled values and, equally importantly, unsampled values at different locations together. Since a major goal in the exercise of mapping is to display organization in space, spatial correlation is a necessity. As for uncertainty it is so pervasive that it is imperative to account for it.},

We utilize that data to provide a brief overview of important trends in foreign aid. Contributors to this special issue draw on AidData as well as other sources to analyze aid transparency, “new” donors (not previously described or analyzed), aid allocation, and aid effectiveness. Our recurring theme in this introductory essay is that AidData and these initial academic projects refine rather than revolutionize our understanding of aid. The database has added significant numbers of new projects, dollar amounts, donors, and details about those projects, though there is much more yet to add. We worry that aid debates have been driven by too little information, and that many claims are based on limited or very poor evidence. Rectifying these problems will not be instantaneous: refining knowledge takes a lot of time and hard work. The common feature of the papers in this special issue is their careful attention to nuance and detail. In spite of what some recent authors have claimed, aid is neither a simple solution nor a sufficient cause of most problems in developing countries; its motivations, distribution, and effects are complex, and shifting. Capturing this complexity requires detailed data, careful thought, and sophisticated methods that allow scholars to make conditional causal and descriptive inferences.},

Recent developments in this field focus on the design of allocation plans using optimization techniques. In this paper we analyze how uncertainty in spatial (input) data propagates through, and affects the results of, an optimization model. The optimization model calculates the optimal location for a ski run based on a slope map, which is derived from a digital elevation model (DEM). The uncertainty propagation is a generic method following a Monte Carlo approach, whereby realizations of the spatially correlated DEM error are generated using ‘sequential Gaussian simulation’. We successfully applied the methodology to a case study in the Austrian Alps, showing the influence of spatial uncertainty on the optimal location of a ski run and the associated development costs. We also discuss the feasibility of routine incorporation of uncertainty propagation methodologies in an SDSS.},
